      <p>Even in the internet age, leaflets are a time honoured way for political parties to get their message across. We want to keep track of how politicians are trying to get your vote, and where they are campaigning.</p>

      <p>Sending us your leaflets is incredibly simple: take a high resolution colour photograph (or better yet, use a scanner if you have one) and submit it to us by clicking on the button below.</p>
