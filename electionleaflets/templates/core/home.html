<h2>Got Election leaflets? Photo them. Upload them.</h2>

<p><a href="{% url "upload_leaflet" %}" class="upload">Upload a leaflet</a></p>

<p>Even in the internet age, leaflets are a time honoured way for political parties to get their message across. We want to keep track of how politicians are trying to get your vote, and where they are campaigning.</p>

<p>Sending us your leaflets is incredibly simple: take a high resolution colour photograph (or better yet, use a scanner if you have one) and submit it to us by clicking on the button below.</p>

    
<h3>Taking a decent photo</h3>

<p>We recommend putting the leaflet on a flat surface like a table in a well lit room and taking a photograph of it from directly above. You might want to turn off the flash.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to take a photograph of all the sides of the leaflet (not just the front), and to ensure that the text is legible.</p>
<h3>I can’t take a photo or scan</h3>

<p>No problem, just post the leaflet to Elections Leaflet, &#8453; Unlock Democracy, 37 Gray’s Inn Road, London WC1X 8PQ and don't forget to include your postcode.</p>
